# ESP32ProtoVer1

- Updates about Project

- Working ESP32 codes, the two locations are code separated, the missing parts and updates to be made (systematically) are the DS1302 then figuring out how the averages part will work
- Working Server.js, before putting to another device, one must prompt in the terminal npm install express mysql2 ws body-parser (Express.js, mysql2, websockets, body-parser)
- Working index.html, charts are showing properly, real-time updating, updates to be made: the average part.
